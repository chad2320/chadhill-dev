# Chads Desktop 
[Link](https://chadhill.dev) Just a fun project to show off my portfolio. Based some aspects off of [poolsuite](https://poolsuite.net) and added a spin to it.

Should work with any browser and screen size.

# Tools


- **[RND](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-rnd)** - Resizable and Draggable components were built using the RND component. I found the tool easy learn and enjoyable to use.
- **[React-Use-Audio-Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-audio-player)** - Built on top of [Howler.Js](https://howlerjs.com/) this tool made working with Howler a breeze in React. Was able to go from 0 to 100% in 2 days on the music player with this tool.
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)** - Used this for the backgrounds and a myriad of smaller things. Made it very easy to quickly add animations. But the performance hit for more indepth animations is drastic compared to bare CSS animations, so I don't think Ill use it in the future.

# Future
Currently its done. But I'll update it with future projects and maybe add more when I do.
